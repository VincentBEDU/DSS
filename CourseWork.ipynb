    "## Introduction\n",
    "The housing market plays a significant role in every nation’s economy (Amin and Al-Din, 2018), as it is classified as a necessity for human existence per Maslow’s theory of needs. Changes in housing prices can have a major impact on individuals, communities, and the broader economic environment. Therefore, policymakers, real estate professionals, and homeowners must fully comprehend the numerous factors impacting these changes in the various geographical regions. In Reading, a thriving town in Berkshire, United Kingdom, the housing market undergoes fluctuating changes caused by several different factors such as location, property physical features, neighbourhood amenities, etc.  According to Zancanella et al., (2018), the physical characteristics of the buildings and their energy efficiency rating are important factors that constitute house prices. While several determinants of house price variation have been extensively studied, empirical examination of the impact of key building attributes such as legal interest and energy efficiency rating remains scarce in this study area. This research aims to bridge this gap by investigating how major building attributes and energy efficiency ratings influence housing price fluctuations in Reading, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of the local housing market.\n"

    "## Literature Review\n",
    "House prices are influenced by myriad factors, including micro and macroeconomic conditions, demographic trends, and housing supply and demand dynamics of the market segment (Abate and Anselin, 2016). Recent studies document how building attributes and energy efficiency ratings play a crucial role in determining housing prices (Zuo and Zhao, 2014; Zhang et al., 2017; Zancanella et al., 2018). Green building certification, which encompasses features such as sustainable construction materials and energy-efficient designs, has gained consideration for its positive impact on house prices (Huang, 2023). The study of Zhang et al., (2023), emphasized that energy-efficient homes tend to command higher prices in the housing market due to their lower utility costs and environmental benefits. However, the specific impact of green building rating on housing price fluctuations in Reading requires further exploration, as the dynamics of the local market may differ from broader market trends.\n",
    "Although most studies focused on traditional factors such as property location, features, and amenities in determining housing prices, the impact of legal interest structures, such as leasehold and freehold arrangements, remains relatively understudied. Legal interest influences property values by shaping ownership rights, maintenance responsibilities, and future development opportunities (Caesar et al, 2019). While several research explored broader determinants of housing price disparities, few have delved into the unique features of local housing markets and their correlation with building attributes and energy efficiency ratings. We therefore aim to address this gap by conducting a thorough analysis of the housing market in Reading, examining how essential building attributes like freehold/leasehold interests and energy efficiency ratings affect fluctuations in housing prices. Through an examination of these factors within the context of Reading's housing market, this research aims to contribute valuable insights for policymakers, professionals, and homeowners looking to comprehend and navigate the intricacies of the local housing market.\n"

    "The data description above shows a total sample size of **69,656** property price data. The average price per square meter and property price are **£2,722** and **£217,018** respectively at Reading. The endogenous or dependent variable for the analysis is the sale property (price). It has a standard deviation of **£144,124.17** demonstrating how property prices spread across Reading geographical regions. However, there exists a large gap between the minimum price of **£400.00** and the maximum of **£3,500,000.00**, which signals the existence of outliers in the dataset. Outliers have an impact on the average value, therefore, it will be examined and dealt with during the analysis.\r\n"
